# bigelow-README-generator

## Description
This project was designed for the purpose of simplifying the process of creating a README file. Rather than having to create it through Github, the user can create the README file through the command line. This project gave me a more thorough understanding of how to use NodeJS and the integrated terminal. Also, I gained a rudimentary understanding of how Inquirer works.

## Installation
To use this application, clone the repo to your device.

## Usage
To use the application, you must first clone the repo to your device. Open index.js in the integrated terminal. To run the application, enter "node index.js" into the terminal. This will bring up a series of prompts for you to create your file. After you have finished, your README file will appear as one of the files in the repo. 

## Credits
This YouTube video helped tremendously with the index.js file: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YivEQFpmHQ. Tutor Jili Jiang helped me sync the index.js file with the generateMarkdown file.
