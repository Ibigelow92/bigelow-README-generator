# bigelow-README-generator

## Description
This project was designed for the purpose of simplifying the process of creating a README file. Rather than having to create it through Github, the user can create the README file through the command line. This project gave me a more thorough understanding of how to use NodeJS and the integrated terminal. Also, I gained a rudimentary understanding of how Inquirer works.

## Installation
To use this application, clone the repo to your device.

## Usage
To use the application, you must first clone the repo to your device. Open index.js in the integrated terminal.

To run the application, enter "node index.js" into the terminal. This will bring up a series of prompts for you to create your file. After you have finished, your README file will appear as one of the files in the repo. 

## Credits
This YouTube video helped tremendously with the index.js file: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YivEQFpmHQ. Tutor Jili Jiang helped me sync the index.js file with the generateMarkdown file.

## Tests
After you have cloned the repo to your device, open index.js in the integrated terminal. Type "node index.js" to initialize the app in the terminal. The terminal should display a prompt asking you to enter your project title. When you input the title and press "enter", you should see what you inputted in cyan and the next prompt should appear below. The app should present you with several more input fields, one after the other. Each should behave more or less like the others. The license prompt is slightly different in that it is a checkbox. Use the up and down arrow keys to move your selection, space to select a license and "enter" to finalize your selection. Afterwards, the app should create a new markdown file in your develop folder.
